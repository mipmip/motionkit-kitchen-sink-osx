# MotionKit Kitchen Sink OS X

This project tries to implement as much graphical elements as possible
from the Cocoa Framework. All elements are programmaticly defined using
the Motion Kit framework.

We just started this project. Contributions are more then welcome.

2. create a controller and a layout class simular to the existing ones
